Hi, I'm a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Davis, with a background in signal processing and machine learning.

I'm currently designing and implementing novel Reinforcement Learning frameworks to enhance the multi-hop question answering capabilities of language models. 

Actively seeking an AI Engineer role to apply these skills to solve real-world challenges.
